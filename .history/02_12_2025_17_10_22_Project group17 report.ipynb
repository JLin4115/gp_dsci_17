    "Our research question for this project was if experience level and play time could act as predictors for subscription status to a game-related newsletters in the players.csv dataset. From our exploratory and predictive analysis, it is observed that these variables are overall, weak predictors of player subscription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, when performing exploratory analysis, figure 1 showed that there was little distinction in subscription levels for different experience classes of players. There was no real trend, as all of the subscription percentiles within each class was ~75%. This was the first indication that experience level likely would have a negligable impact on if a player was subscribed or not. This would also contribute to a less accurate predictor because it has less of a pattern to go off of.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when looking at playtime, there was a clear distinction in subscription levels for players who played less versus more; figure 2 highlighted that players who had an average playtime of 0.5 hours during data collection were not subscribed to game-related newsletters. Contrastingly, it showed that players who had an average playtime of 7+ hours during the data collection were subscribed. This visualization had a clear pattern, which indicated that playtime would be a better predictor for the knn model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 showed that certain patterns were present for some experience classes, while no trends were observed for other classes. For example for classes 1 and 4, players that had a higher playtime appeared to have higher subscription levels. However, for classes 2, 3, and 5, despite some outlier data points, playtime did not appear to be correlated with subscription status. This confirmed that although playtime was a better predictor than experience level, there was no clear trend in the subscription status based on both predictors combined. This indicated that the predictor that we would create was likely to have low accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our predictive analysis confirmed that our chosen variables failed to serve as predictors for subcription status. After finding the number of neighbors that resulted in the highest prediction accuracy, the accuracy was still only 73%. For a prediction model, this is extremely poor. The predictor will be incorrect about its predictions over a quater of the time! "

    "The findings from this analysis have several important implications for marketing teams and corporations. First, the results show that experience level offers very limited value as a segmentation variable. Since subscription rates remained relatively consistent across all experience categories, marketers cannot rely on experience level to predict which players are likely to subscribe to newsletters. This means that campaigns designed to target players based on their experience level alone are unlikely to be effective or generate a meaningful return on investment.\n"
